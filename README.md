# OpenWeatherMap

I have created the OpenWeatherMap app using .net 6 frameork and swagger for api testing.
also created the unit test project using Xunit and added few test cases.
also i have use inmemory caching if same location is asked multiple times, but it will cache data only for 5 min. this field is configurable.
after 5 min it will again get the data from API.

I have not worked wit API Management tool , so have not implemented that part.
